This project aims to model derates for California's thermal power plants based
on ambient weather conditions, primarily temperature. The model synthesizes data
from CAISO's [Prior Trade-Day Curtailment Reports](https://www.caiso.com/market/Pages/OutageManagement/CurtailedandNonOperationalGenerators.aspx)
and NCEI/NOAA's [Hourly Surface Weather](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/global-hourly/)
dataset.
